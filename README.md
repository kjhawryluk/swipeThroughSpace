Welcome to Swipe Through Space!

For my final project, I created an app that can be thought of as "Tinder 
for Nasa pictures". When you enter my app, you can search for a space 
topic of your choosing in the top bar. My app calls Nasa's image api and 
returns images that are relevant to that topic. You can then swipe right 
on the pictures you like to favorite them or left if you dislike them. 
Also, feel free to share a picture with your friends by pressing the
share button underneath the photo (in portrait mode only). 

After you're done swiping through pictures, you can use the options menu 
to choose to see your favorites or disliked photos. You can then tap the 
photo to see a bigger version of it. Press the heart icon if you feel you 
mis-swiped, and the photo will be sent to the other list. Also, if you 
select Settings from the option menu, you can change the app's 
theme from dark to light. Also, you can choose to have the tutorial pop-up
show again the next time you open the app. Finally, if you want to checkout
a previous search you made, select Search History from the options menu. 
Here, you can tap the query to search it again, or your can press the 
trash icon to delete the query if you didn't like what you saw.

Thanks for checking out Swipe Through Space!
